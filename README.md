# Grieg

General-purpose logical inference engine built in Rust, designed to extend and surpass prior prototypes (LEE).

## Project Overview

Grieg implements phase-based logic evaluation inspired by Basis5 geometry and counterfactual inference.  
It is intended for legal, technical, and scientific reasoning across multiple domains.
