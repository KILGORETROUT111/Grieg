# Grieg — SAP Integration Pack v1

Grieg is a **phase-aware reasoning engine** (Rust) with four phases — **JAM, MEM, VAC, ALIVE** — and strict dominance (**JAM > MEM > VAC > ALIVE**).  
This pack connects Grieg’s evaluator to SAP-aligned workflows at the **edge** (factory cells, retail stores, clinics, field/defense nodes), using **JSON/JSONL** as a first-class I/O surface and `grieg-ipc` for integration plumbing.

(Full README content as previously drafted — keep/replace as desired.)
