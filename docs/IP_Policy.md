# Intellectual Property Policy  

## 1. Proprietary Foundations  
The Grieg/LEE codebase reflects a **background theory** that remains proprietary and is not part of this public repository. The rigor of the codebase itself — its modular design and phase logic — is the canonical reference available to the public.  

## 2. No Entitlement to Disclosure  
Outside parties have **no entitlement** to demand additional disclosures, papers, or internal theory. The codebase is already unusually rigorous for an open project. If that rigor is not sufficient for your purposes, this project may not be for you.  

## 3. Respect and Conduct  
We expect engagement on the basis of:  
- Technical questions about the public code.  
- Good-faith contributions and improvements.  
- Professional respect in discussion.  

We do **not** accept:  
- Repeated demands for access to private intellectual property.  
- Attempts to pressure or shame contributors into disclosures.  
- Bad-faith argument about what “ought” to be public.  

Such behavior will result in immediate disengagement.  

## 4. Boundaries Are Clear  
- **Public:** the codebase, its documentation, and the operational demonstrations included here.  
- **Private:** the background theory, internal research notes, and other materials explicitly withheld.  

## 5. Caveat for Grantors and Formal Reviewers  
In cases of **formal evaluation** (e.g. research grants, academic peer review, legal/IP review), background materials may be disclosed at the discretion of the author under controlled conditions. This is an exception, not the rule.
