> **Abstract**  
> Grieg began as a *supremely evolved background theory*—a way to replace the hidden heuristics of reasoning with a phase-verified cycle (VAC → ALIVE → JAM → MEM).  
> Just as AWS is now verifying Rust’s standard library to prove away unsafe assumptions in systems code, Grieg aims to prove away unsafe assumptions in inference itself.  
> Together these efforts mark a cultural turn: from trusting background assumptions to demanding provable substrates, at both the machine and reasoning layers.
