# Origin Note: Supremely Evolved Background Theory  

Grieg’s lineage can be traced to an idea I once called a **“supremely evolved background theory.”**  
The phrase described the attempt to surface and rebuild the tacit assumptions that underlie reasoning itself. Traditional AI engines rely on heuristics, probability mandates, and compensating errors — an *unsafe substrate* for inference. Grieg was conceived as the counterpoint: a system where reasoning is not heuristic but **phase-verified** through the VAC → ALIVE → JAM → MEM cycle.  

## Parallel to Rust Verification  
This trajectory mirrors, in spirit, what AWS and the Rust Foundation are now pursuing with the Rust standard library. Rust has long promised memory safety, yet its standard library still contains thousands of `unsafe` seams. By applying model checkers like ESBMC and Kani, AWS is transforming those hidden assumptions into **explicit, checkable proofs**.  

- **Rust verification:** safe code at the machine substrate.  
- **Grieg:** safe inference at the reasoning substrate.  

## Toward Provable Substrates  
Both efforts signal the same cultural turn: from trusting background assumptions to **demanding background guarantees**. Verified code on the machine side, verified reasoning on the intelligence side. Two halves of a single shift toward a world built on **provable substrates** rather than fragile heuristics.
