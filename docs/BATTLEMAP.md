Got it. Here’s Part 1 prepared as a Markdown file you can drop directly into the repo as README-BATTLEMAP.md:

# Grieg Adoption Battle Map (Part 1)

This document outlines priority verticals and sequencing for Grieg adoption.  
The goal: establish **invariant telemetry as non-negotiable** across defense, medical, cyber, and industrial systems.  
Once top contractors demand it, ERP vendors (SAP, Oracle, others) will follow.

---

## Tier 1 — Immediate Entry (Low Resistance / High Urgency)

These verticals already face regulatory and mission-critical pressure to adopt **provable invariants**.

### Defense & Aerospace  
**Targets:** Raytheon, Lockheed, Airbus, DARPA, ESA, DoD contractors  
- **Why:** Compliance, “no-black-box” mandates, mission assurance.  
- **Wedge:** Grieg IPC + JSONL logs = provable invariants.  
- **Tactic:** Demonstrate mock telemetry on command/control chains; show JAM/MEM transitions as safety cert evidence.  

### Medical & Pharma  
**Targets:** Novartis, Roche, Pfizer, GE Healthcare  
- **Why:** FDA/EU regulators demand explainability; med devices can’t be opaque.  
- **Wedge:** MEM transport = auditable decisioning in diagnostics.  
- **Tactic:** Use JSONL as a regulatory audit log; pair with SAP/Oracle Health.  

### Cybersecurity / Cyber Command  
**Targets:** USCYBERCOM, NATO, private SOCs, FireEye/Mandiant  
- **Why:** Zero-trust + explainability is doctrine.  
- **Wedge:** JAM dominance = natural invariant for intrusion detection.  
- **Tactic:** Show MEM/VAC states as anomaly markers integrated into SIEM pipelines.  

---

## Tier 2 — Expansion (Medium Resistance, Huge Impact)

Follows once Tier 1 adoption proves viability. They won’t move first but will comply once contracts demand it.

### Industrial Automation & Robotics  
**Targets:** Siemens, ABB, Fanuc, Kuka  
- **Why:** Factory floors + edge robotics require determinism.  
- **Wedge:** VAC → ALIVE witness arrival = sensor verification.  
- **Tactic:** Feed IPC telemetry into SAP Digital Twin for manufacturing.  

### Energy & Utilities  
**Targets:** Shell, BP, Siemens Energy, nuclear ops, grid operators  
- **Why:** Grid stability + cyber-risk; regulators demand invariant proofs.  
- **Wedge:** Transport (MEM) = cross-sheet event for grid-state shifts.  
- **Tactic:** Replay energy incidents with Grieg logs to prove compliance.  

---

## Tier 3 — Long Game (High Resistance, Eventual)

### Finance  
**Targets:** JPM, Goldman, ECB, BIS  
- **Why:** Explainable AI + systemic risk tracking.  
- **Wedge:** IPC logs prove counterfactual reasoning (“what if” trades).  
- **Tactic:** Provide invariant proofs for risk auditing frameworks.  

### Government Civil / Academic  
**Targets:** EU Horizon, DARPA seed projects, universities  
- **Why:** Procurement standards and slow adoption cycles.  
- **Wedge:** MEM transport = chain-of-custody in digital evidence.  
- **Tactic:** Seed through grant calls and research projects.  

---

## Strategy in One Line

**Sell invariants to Raytheon, Novartis, Cyber Command → they write it into contracts → SAP/Oracle have no choice.**

---

*Part 2 will extend this into endpoint-agnostic adoption, covering SAP, Oracle, and non-ERP systems (e.g. robotics, cybernetics).*

Do you want me to also wire this into your repo structure now (like /docs/README-BATTLEMAP.md) and stage/push with the same workflow as the SAP and MML docs, or keep it local until Part 2 is ready?
