# Lineage

This document records the intellectual heritage behind **Grieg**.
It is not technical documentation but a statement of origin, included here to honor the tradition that shaped this project.

## Berkeley Discipline

The operator discipline of Grieg traces directly to the Berkeley program of **Julian C. Boyd** (RIP). That program established a standard: clarity of reasoning, intellectual accountability, and respect for the chain of logic above all.

Grieg is a continuation of that standard in computational form. Where the academy of today often treats silence as protocol, Grieg treats explicitness as law: each inference cycle is recorded, each geometry emitted, each contradiction resolved.

## Purpose of Inclusion

This lineage is not meant as autobiography. It is included because **Grieg’s stance is cultural as much as technical**:

* The culture of answering good work with good work.
* The culture of acknowledging, not ignoring.
* The culture of maintaining honor through discipline.

These are values passed down, and they are embedded in the engine.

## Position in the Repository

For developers, the core references are in:

* [CONTRACTS\_BASIS5.md](CONTRACTS_BASIS5.md)
* [docs/verification.md](docs/verification.md)

For context, this page stands alongside them — not to change the spec, but to mark the heritage that gives the spec its seriousness.
