### Phase Geometry and Generativity

Grieg represents each evaluated claim as a point in **phase space**, encoding its semantic-logic profile. Transformations (paraphrase, assumption exposure, counterfactual modification) move claims through this space, revealing **convergence, divergence, and instability**.

Grieg does not assign truth values to phase states, nor does it generate new claims. Its function is evaluative: to assess **structural integrity** rather than to assert external factuality.
