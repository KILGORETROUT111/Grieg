# Verification and Provable Substrates

## 1. Gödel and the Boundaries of Consistency

Gödel showed that within any sufficiently strong formal system, the attempt to *demonstrate* its own consistency outruns the system: the proof “goes infinite.”  
Consistency, once it surpasses arithmetic, demands an external structure. Geometry historically became that structure.

## 2. Geometry, Autonomy, and Uncertainty

When axioms are carried into geometric form, they gain **partial autonomy**:  
- Coexistence is possible without collapse into contradiction.  
- This aligns with the uncertainty principle, where two states can be “simultaneous” yet not fully determinate.  
- Logical consistency is preserved **through transformations**, not through static completeness.

## 3. Relativistic Domain and the Role of Time

In relativistic settings, consistency across simultaneous states is guaranteed by the **geometry of transformations**.  
If geometry + consistency alone were sufficient, time would be unnecessary.  
The fact that consistency requires transformation implies that **time itself is structural** to logic when extended beyond arithmetic.

## 4. Toward Demonstrable Substrates

This insight drives a parallel between:

- **Rust Verification (AWS, ESMBC, Kani, etc.)**:  
  Formal verification of the substrate (the standard library, safety guarantees, model checking).
  
- **Grieg**:  
  Phase-resolved inference engine (ALIVE, JAM, MEM, VAC) where consistency is *demonstrable* via phases and witnesses.  
  Grieg provides a substrate for reasoning that is:  
  - **Operational** (commands and outputs are reproducible).  
  - **Transformational** (phases encode transitions, not just static results).  
  - **Provable** (JSONL conformance, CI, examples serve as live demonstration).

## 5. Demonstrability

Grieg’s verification stance is practical:

- **Executable semantics**: Every phase distinction (ALIVE, JAM, MEM, VAC) is observable at the CLI.  
- **Conformance sets**: JSONL batches (e.g. [`conformance/smoke.jsonl`](../conformance/smoke.jsonl)) show expected outcomes that can be re-run by anyone.  
- **Phase dominance**: JAM > MEM > VAC > ALIVE serves as a verifiable law of operation.  
- **Geometry optionality**: With `emit_geometry` off, outcomes remain invariant; with it on, traces provide additional witness structure.

Thus, where Gödel showed the limit of consistency proofs, Grieg positions itself as a **demonstrable substrate**: one that shows, through operational witnesses, how consistency can be carried forward by phases, geometry, and time.
