# Verification and Provable Substrates

## 1. Gödel and the Boundaries of Consistency
Gödel showed that within any sufficiently strong formal system, the attempt to *demonstrate* its own consistency outruns the system. Consistency, once it surpasses arithmetic, demands an external structure—historically, geometry.

## 2. Geometry, Autonomy, and Uncertainty
When axioms are carried into geometric form, they gain **partial autonomy**:
- Coexistence without collapse into contradiction.
- Alignment with the uncertainty principle (two states can be “simultaneous” yet not fully determinate).
- Consistency preserved **through transformations**, not static completeness.

## 3. Relativistic Domain and the Role of Time
In relativistic settings, consistency across simultaneous states is guaranteed by the **geometry of transformations**.  
If geometry + consistency alone were sufficient, time would be unnecessary. The need for transformation implies **time is structural** when logic extends beyond arithmetic.

## 4. Parallel: Rust Verification ↔ Grieg
- **Rust/AWS**: formal verification of the substrate (stdlib), via model checkers (e.g., Kani/ESBMC), CI, and proofs.
- **Grieg**: a phase-resolved reasoning substrate (ALIVE, JAM, MEM, VAC) where consistency is demonstrable via phases and witnesses.

## 5. Demonstrability (What reviewers can run)
- **Executable semantics**: phase outcomes are observable at the CLI.
- **Conformance**: [`conformance/smoke.jsonl`](../conformance/smoke.jsonl) encodes expected phases for batch runs.
- **Dominance law**: `JAM > MEM > VAC > ALIVE` (verifiable).
- **Geometry optionality**: with `emit_geometry` off, outcomes are invariant; with it on, traces add witness structure.

Thus, where Gödel marks limits of internal consistency proofs, Grieg offers a **demonstrable substrate**: operational witnesses that carry consistency through phases, geometry, and time.
